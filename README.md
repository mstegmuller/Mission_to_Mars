# Mission_to_Mars

The purpose of this challenge was to scrape Mars related data off the internet and to create an HTML file to show the information we found.  We used Mars facts and hemisphere data for the challenge.  In the challenge we had to create a py file that could retrieve the images and create a mongo database to contain and update the images.  Lastly, we had to update the HTML file to retrieve the newly scaped hemisphere data.  The data should compatible with computers and other mobile devices such as iphones and ipads.
